# AIDevelopmentFramework

## Overview

Open-source agentic AI coding framework built on the PIV+E loop (Plan, Implement, Validate, Evolve). Claude Code primary, methodology portable to any AI coding tool.

## Tech Stack

- Claude Code CLI (commands, agents, skills, rules, hooks)
- Node.js (CLI tool)
- GitHub (issues, milestones, PRs)

## Core Principles

1. **Context is precious** — manage it deliberately; recommend context resets for complex work
2. **Plans are artifacts** — they survive session boundaries and pass the "no prior knowledge" test
3. **Discipline scales with complexity** — XL features get full ceremony, S tweaks get fast-tracked
4. **The system self-improves** — every AI mistake becomes a rule, pattern, or guardrail
5. **Ship everything, install nothing** — framework works out of the box; external plugins stay fresh from source

## Pipeline Commands (PIV+E)

| Command | Phase | Purpose |
|---------|-------|---------|
| `/start` | Router | Detects scope level, routes to correct pipeline |
| `/prime` | Plan | Loads codebase context into session |
| `/create-prd` | Plan | Generates PRD from idea (includes brainstorming) |
| `/plan-project` | Plan | Decomposes PRD into GitHub milestones + issues |
| `/plan-feature` | Plan | Creates detailed implementation plan for a feature |
| `/execute` | Implement | Executes plan with TDD, domain skills, parallel agents |
| `/validate` | Validate | Runs verification, testing agents, code review |
| `/ship` | Validate | Commits, pushes, creates PR, finishes branch |
| `/evolve` | Evolve | Updates rules and knowledge base from learnings |
| `/setup` | Utility | Checks installed plugins/skills, reports health |

## Scope Levels

- **L0 (Project):** /brainstorm → /create-prd → /plan-project → /create-rules → per-issue L2
- **L1 (Feature):** /brainstorm → /plan-feature → creates issue(s) → per-issue L2
- **L2 (Issue):** gh issue view → /prime → /writing-plans → /execute → /validate → /ship
- **L3 (Bug):** gh issue view → /prime → /systematic-debugging → fix → /validate → /ship

## Mode Selection

For non-trivial tasks, choose your discipline level:

- **Superpowers Mode:** Full PIV+E pipeline — brainstorm → plan → TDD → execute → verify → review → ship → evolve
- **Standard Mode:** Lighter workflow — plan → implement → validate → ship

## Agents

- **architect-agent** — Codebase knowledge base. Call before structural changes (RETRIEVE/IMPACT/RECORD/PATTERN)
- **tester-agent** — Web browser testing via playwright-cli (VERIFY/FLOW)
- **mobile-tester-agent** — Mobile app testing via mobile-mcp (VERIFY/FLOW)
- **ui-ux-analyzer** — Design audit agent with screenshots and reports

## Rules & References

- Domain-specific rules auto-load from `.claude/rules/` based on file paths being edited
- Reference templates in `.claude/references/` are loaded on-demand by commands
- See `docs/customization.md` for adding custom rules and agents

## External Dependencies

Run `/setup` to check what's installed. See `docs/plugin-install-guide.md` for full list.
